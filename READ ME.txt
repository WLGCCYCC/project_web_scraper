Note:
1. This program runs under python 3.

2. Module list:
	requests
	math
	bs4(beautiful soup)
	xlsxwriter
(Please make sure that you have all of the modules correctlly installed.)

3. run using command line:
	
	python project_web_scraper.py

4. Make sure abbrev_to_state.py and city_to_state.py are under the same directory with project_web_scaper.py

5. The result xlsx file will be produced under the working directory.

6. Important: Theoretically, it can collect all the firms within a state.

However, I only test it by searching for all the firms within RI, which is a relatively small state.

If you try to search entire CA, GOOD LUCK!
